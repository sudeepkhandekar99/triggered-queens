# ♟️ Triggered Queens

A chess behavior debugger for players stuck on Lichess ratings.

> Triggered Queens helps chess players break rating stagnation by identifying recurring mistake patterns across games and prescribing habit-level fixes, not generic engine advice.

------------



## 🧠 Problem

Many Lichess players between 1600–2000 struggle to increase rating despite studying tactics, openings, and endgames.

The issue is not lack of knowledge, it is repeated, unconscious mistakes that go undetected by traditional game analysis tools.

Stockfish explains what went wrong in a single game, but not why the same mistake keeps happening across many games.


------------



## 🎯 Goal

Build a minimal product that:
	•	Detects recurring mistake patterns across a player’s recent Lichess games
	•	Diagnoses why a player is plateaued
	•	Prescribes one focused corrective constraint at a time


------------



## 🚀 MVP Features (v1)

### Lichess Game Import

- Authenticate via Lichess OAuth or username
- Fetch last N games (default: 30–50)
- Extract:
 - PGN
 - Move timestamps
 - Result
 - Time control
 - Rating change


------------



### Engine-Assisted Mistake Extraction

Using Stockfish (offline or containerized):
- Analyze critical positions only (large eval swings)
- Label moves as:
 - Blunder
 - Mistake
 - Inaccuracy
- Track:
 - Eval loss
 - Move number
 - Game phase (opening / middlegame / endgame)

⚠️ Full per-move analysis is intentionally avoided to keep compute low.


------------



### Recurring Mistake Pattern Detection

Aggregate mistakes across games to identify repeating habits, such as:
- Hanging pieces after forcing moves
- Trading into losing endgames
- Collapsing under time pressure
- Over-pushing pawns with king uncastled

Output:
- Top 3 recurring mistake categories
- Frequency across losses
- Average eval loss per category


------------



### Plateau Diagnosis Report

Generate a short diagnostic summary:

Example:

“You are stuck around 1800 primarily due to repeated endgame transitions and time-pressure blunders. 62% of your losses occurred from equal or better positions after move 30.”

Includes:
- Win/Loss phase breakdown
- Blunder frequency by game phase
- Time trouble correlation


------------



### Constraint-Based Fix (The Core Feature)

Assign ONE non-negotiable constraint for the next 10 games.

Examples:
- “No trades unless you gain material”
- “Castle by move 10 in every game”
- “Pause 5 seconds before every capture”
-  "No pawn moves on the flank before castling”

Track:
- Constraint compliance
- Win rate change
- Blunder rate change


------------



## 🧩 Non-Goals (Intentionally Excluded)
- Real-time engine assistance (fair play risk)
- Opening databases / theory trees
- Puzzle trainers
- Full coaching automation

This MVP focuses only on breaking rating plateaus.


------------



## 🛠️ Tech Stack 

Backend
- Python + FastAPI
- Stockfish (UCI engine)
- PostgreSQL
- Celery / background tasks

Frontend
